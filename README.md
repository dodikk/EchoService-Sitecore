EchoService-Sitecore
====================

A simple echo service prototype for the web service based on the Sitecore instance. It can be used as a template for developing more complex modules.


##Rationale

Web API modules are an important **extension point** of the Sitecore CMS. Having a well defined RESTful API is the easiest way to provide data for mobile applications or any other third-party clients. Still, it may be a challeging task for some beginners.

This **tutorial** will cover the basics of creating **Web API service** for Sitecore. As a result, you'll get a minimalistic "hello world" project and some instructions on deploying it.




##Getting Started
In order to add your Web API to Sitecore you should 

1. Put the **assembly** of your module to the ```bin``` directory of your instance
